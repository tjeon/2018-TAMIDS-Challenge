# CSCE-633 Machine Learning Project code


The code is written in Python 2.7 and some open source libraries including Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Keras are used. You need to have all of these libraries to run our code.

How to run the code?

1. The datasets comprising 5 csv files should be in a folder named "TAMIDS_dataset", which also should be in the same directory where the code is. These files are so huge (around 50 GBs in total) that we did not turn them in along with our code. If you need the datasets, please send us an email and we will give them to you.

2. Open "ML_model.ipynb"

3. Run all of the blocks in the Jupyter notebook "sequentially".

For reproducing the results with the dataset from 2013 to 2015, you need to run "ML_model_13_15.ipynb".

If you want to reproduce the visualization results, run "plot_example.ipynb" and follow the instructions in the code.
